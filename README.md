# About this Project
This project is a simple way to make an artificial neural network. My objectif is to learn how big framework like Tensorflow or Pytorch work. I want to make a simple framework that can be used in a lot of different case.

# How to launch a sample:

1. Execute the following line:
```sh
python3 main.py [sample]
```
2. Be happy!!! :)

# List of content:

## Sample
- [x] basciNeuron
- [x] basicNetwork
- [x] patternRecognition

## Activation
- [x] Basic Activation
- [x] Sigmoid
- [x] Tanh
- [x] ReLU
- [ ] LeakyReLU
- [ ] Softmax

## Gradient
- [x] Basic Gradient
- [ ] Momentum
- [ ] Nesterov
- [ ] Adagrad
- [ ] RMSprop


# How to use this project:
If you want to use this project, there is two way to do it:
1. You can add in the folder 'sample' a new file with the name of your sample. You can copy/paste the file 'sample/basicNeuron.py' and change the content of the function.
2. You can replace the 'main.py' file by your own file. And just reproduce one of the sample's class method.

> In utils folder, you can find activated/gradient function. You can add your own network.
